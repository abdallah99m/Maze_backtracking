# Maze_backtracking
Program that solve any maze by backtracking algorithm


A backtracking algorithm is a recursive algorithm that attempts to solve a given problem by testing all possible paths towards a solution until a solution is found. 
Each time a path is tested, if a solution is not found, the algorithm backtracks to test another possible path and so on till a solution is found or all paths have been tested.


The typical scenario where a backtracking algorithm is when you try to find your way out in a maze. Every time you reach a dead-end, 
you backtrack to try another path until you find the exit or all path have been explored.
